          SortVision's interactive visualizer helps you see exactly how it works 
          before moving to more complex algorithms.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the best sorting algorithm to learn first?</h3>
        <p>
          For beginners, we recommend starting with Bubble Sort to understand
          basic comparison and swapping concepts, then progressing to Insertion
          Sort and Selection Sort before tackling more advanced algorithms like
          Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I prepare for sorting algorithm interview questions?</h3>
        <p>
